# Backlog — deferred, with the reason

Things measured or reasoned about but not built. Kept here so they are decisions
rather than omissions.

## 1. Multi-contour shapes — SOLVED, see `multi_contour.py`

**What it was.** Every stage of the pipeline takes ONE closed curve:
`shape_library`, `place_shape`, the Viterbi matcher, `shape_distance`. A shape
with a hole or a separate part could not be expressed. POC 8 measured Chrome's
dinosaur eye at 13×12 px — 6.4% of the shape's width, or 128 m at a 2 km target,
comfortably above the ~50 m this street network resolves. It was not too small to
draw; it was structurally unrepresentable. The same limit blocked text-to-shape:
LOVE is 5 closed contours, TAIPEI is 8, and `A B D O P Q R` all have counters.

**The fix, and whose it was.** The user's, not the metric's: link the contours
with the shortest connectors and ride each connector out and back. The result is
one closed curve, and nothing downstream needs to change — not the metric, not
the search, not the fit. The product question this item said had to be answered
first ("two walks? a marked gap? a connecting leg?") turned out to have a fourth
answer that made it moot.

**What it cost, measured** (`poc11_onestroke.py`): the connectors add 5.6% of
perimeter for LIT, 6.1% for LOVE, 10.0% for TAIPEI, and are hairlines on the map.

**What it did not fix.** Distance. Merging is cheap; words are not. n_min tracks
features, not contours: LIT 84, LOVE 160, TAIPEI 240, which at the bike street
scale is 30 / 56 / 85 km and needs the word drawn 4.5 / 7.7 / 10.7 km wide. A
word is wide and short, so its strokes end up closer together than the street
scale can resolve. **The blocker moved from topology to distance** — which is
item 6 below, and a different kind of problem.

## 2. Are these routes actually walkable? — the untested risk

**What.** Nobody has verified a single generated route against reality, or even
against street-level imagery.

**Why it matters.** osmnx's `walk` filter admits footways, steps, corridors and
service alleys. POC 1's own diagnostics found a snapped node whose edges were
`['steps', 'footway', 'corridor']`. A route may pass through a building's
interior passage, an underpass locked at night, or a construction site. Every
metric in this project measures shape fidelity; none measures whether a person
can complete the walk.

**Cheapest first step** (no fieldwork): tabulate the `highway` tags along a
generated route and report what fraction sits on steps, corridors, service ways
and paths tagged `access=customers` or similar. That alone would size the
problem.

## 3. The recognisability ceiling — still unmeasured

POC 6's v2 threshold task anchored every pair to the clean route, which
guaranteed one good member and so recorded zero "neither looks like it" answers.
Measuring where a shape stops reading as itself at all needs **unanchored pairs
AND the four-option response together** — the two fixes have never been in the
same instrument.

## 4. A rater round on feature destruction

POC 7 found that merging the dinosaur's legs costs 0.060 in metric terms, below
the ~0.10 threshold at which a person reliably sees a difference — while a
defining feature is gone. That is POC 4's cleft finding at larger scale, and it
has never been put to a rater on a complex shape. Needs a fresh rater, since the
existing one has done three rounds.

## 5. Detour ratio as a constant

`route_feasibility` assumes ~1.30. Stable across five shapes at 2 km, and
validated in POC 9 across sizes — but it is an empirical constant from one city,
and a different street grid would move it.
## 6. Words are too long to ride — the new text blocker

Following from item 1. Four directions; one is now tested and dead.

**Tested, and it does not help: a single-stroke font.** POC 12 built one (26
glyphs, `stroke_font.py`) on the reasonable guess that one line down the middle
of each letter would be cheaper than tracing both edges. It is not. A line with
no thickness has to be ridden out and back, so it costs 2× its length — which is
roughly what an outline's perimeter already is. Measured at equal width the two
styles are within 7% (LIT 0.93, LOVE 1.05, TAIPEI 0.96). Worse, n_min rises
27–43%, because with everything a thin line the connectors from item 1 become
indistinguishable from letter strokes: in LIT the link between the I's top bar
and the T's top bar is collinear with both and fuses the letters. Shipped as a
user-selectable style regardless — wanting it is legitimate — but it is not a
route to shorter rides.

**Untested:** short words only (a feasibility gate that rejects TAIPEI before
drawing it, which `route_feasibility` can already do); a taller font or stacked
lines, to spend width on height instead of length; or accepting a multi-day /
multi-segment route, which is a product decision, not an algorithmic one.


## 7. The metric is wrong for text — rotation must be a constraint

POC 12 fitted "LIT" to the bike network with rotation free, as every POC since 6
has done. The search returned tilted placements and `shape_distance` scored them
well — outline 0.066, stroke 0.124 — and neither reads as a word. Forced
upright, the routes read as letters and the metric scored them *worse*, 0.114
and 0.164. For text the metric is not merely blind to orientation, it prefers
the unreadable fit.

Rotation invariance was not a mistake when it was adopted: POC 5's rater called
tilted and upright hearts equally heart-like, and POC 6 built the search on
that. It is simply not a property of every shape. The shape has to carry its own
orientation constraint — free for a heart, fixed for a word, probably a narrow
band for a dinosaur — and the metric needs an orientation term for the shapes
that have one. Neither exists yet.

Until then `poc12_word_routes.py` pins `ROTATIONS_DEG = (0.0,)` by hand.
